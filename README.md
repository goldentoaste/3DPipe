# 3DPipe
pipes pipes pipes

#
A old Unity project I found on my conputer which I decided finish today, it was suppose to render random 3d pipes like the screen saver from [windows XP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKqrLGFoK9E)


This project's rendering has somes issues(might be because each segment's normal is pointer at slightly different directions?), its code reads like a fever dream and in general is not nearly as 
good as windows xp's, but I'll consider this done :P


try it out [here](https://goldentoaste.github.io/pipes/)
